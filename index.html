      <h1>This is the DT Coding Comeback Tour</h1>
    <p>I started a new position in February of this year and have not been coding or learning since. It's discouraging how much I think I've lost, because I not only did not continue to learn, but did not properly cement what I had learned through constant practice and application.</p>
